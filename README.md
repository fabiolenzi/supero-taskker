#TASKKER!

Tasklist developed for Supero code challenge.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
You can find the API server repository [here](https://github.com/fabiolenzi/supero-api).

This project uses [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Material-IU](https://material-ui.com/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Set `local = true` on `src/services/TasksService.js` if you want to use a local API server instead of production.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
